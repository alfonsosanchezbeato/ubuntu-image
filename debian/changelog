ubuntu-image (0.15+17.04ubuntu1) zesty; urgency=medium

  * ubuntu-image now supports gadget.yaml files with multiple volume
    specifications.  Each volume describes a different disk image.  For
    the multi-volume case, no implicit root file system structure is added
    at all; the root file system partition must be defined in the
    gadget.yaml.  -o/--output is ignored in the multi-volume case.
    (LP: #1641727)
  * Add -O/--output-dir command line options.  Disk image files are
    written here using the volume name and a .img suffix.  Deprecate
    -o/--output.  -O and -o are mutually exclusive.
  * Handle structure parts with size or offset < 1MiB.  (LP: #1630709)
  * Warn when the size or offset is not a multiple of the sector size.
    (LP: #1663172 and LP: #1621151)
  * Allow and ignore any string values in the ``defaults`` section.

    from /tmp (model assertions and extra snaps).  (LP: #1663424)

  * Refuse to write images to /tmp when running ubuntu-image as a snap,
    since the snap's /tmp is not accessible to the user.  (LP: #1646968)
  * When sparse copying the resulting disk image, don't try to preserve
    mode,ownership,timestamps.  Over remote file systems (e.g. afp, hgfs)
    this can fail.  Over local file systems, they'll be preserved anyway.

ubuntu-image (0.12+17.04ubuntu1) zesty; urgency=medium

  * Revert previous change which sorted structure volumes by their
    offset.  Instead, we preserve gadget.yaml order for purposes of
    partition numbering, but we still provide implicit offsets when they
    are missing, and we still sanity check for partition overlap.
    (LP: #1642999)
  * Provide human-readable error messages on gadget.yaml parser failures,
    not Python tracebacks (unless --debug is given).  (LP: #1617421)
  * Change the way we invoke the autopkgtests.
    - Use a standard d/t/control file instead of d/t/control.autodep8.  We
      were only using the Python 3 import test anyway.
    - Add an import.sh stanza to reproduce the Python 3 import bits we
      lost by removing autodep8.
    - Turn the `tox -e coverage` Test-Command into a separate test
      script so that we can manipulate the $UBUNTU_IMAGE_CODENAME
      environment variable.  This is used by tox.ini to select an
      appropriate *-coverage.ini file since Xenial does not and cannot
      cover certain code paths.  Everything after Xenial gets named 'devel'.
    - Narrow the dependencies so that they aren't just importing all
      binary packages.  The effects may be similar, but EIBTI.
  * d/control: Drop Testsuite header; we're not doing autodep8 anymore.
  * Rename the environment variable $UBUNTUIMAGE_MOCK_SNAP to
    $UBUNTU_IMAGE_MOCK_SNAP for consistency.
  * Skip some tests which touch the actual store when running without
    network access (e.g. during package build time).
  * Move the __version__ calculation to the package's __init__.py
  * Parse all YAML integer-like values as strings, and then turn them into
    integers if necessary during post-processing.  (LP: #1640523)
  * gadget.yaml files can include an optional `format` key which names the
    version number supported by the gadget.yaml.  Currently only format 0
    is supported, which is a legacy version (omitting the format is
    equivalent).  (LP: #1638926)
  * d/control: Add run-time dependencies which are missing from snapd but
    are required for `snap prepare-image`.  (LP: #1642427)
  * Structures with type='mbr' are deprecated.  Use structure role
    instead.  (LP: #1638660)
  * mbr structures must start at offset 0.  (LP: #1630769)
  * Fixed sanity checking of --image-size argument for out-of-offset-order
    structure definitions.  (LP: #1643598)
  * Prevent wrapping blobs in disk partitions by using the `type: bare`
    structure key.  (LP: #1645750)

    defined implicitly (i.e. not present in the gadget.yaml).  Also, check
    for any structure conflicts and raise a ValueError in that case.
    (LP: #1631423)
  * offset-write arguments will only accept 32 bit integers.  (LP: #1617443)
